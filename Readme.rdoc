== Simpreter a.k.a Simple Interpreter
Simple interpret takes input in between rectangular brackets, then print them if print *variable_name* is presented in its scope, if not defined then it will show "0".

=== Scope:
Many programming languages implement scope for variables â€“ and they are context sensitive. For example a global scope variable will be over-ridden using local variable definition. You need to implement simple interpreter which tells us current value of a variable, if its not defined then value should be zero, Input will start with '[' and will end with matching ']'

This interpreter takes input like this:

  [
    a 10
    b 10
    print a
    print b
    [
      a 20
      print a
      print b
     ]
   ]

And generates an output for the above input like this:

  10  
  10
  20
  10
